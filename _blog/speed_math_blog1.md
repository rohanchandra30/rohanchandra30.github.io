description: A new method to multiply numbers by 9, 99, 999.. very easily

####Here's a quick shortcut for multiplying numbers by 9.For AB X 9, subtract A + 1, then append 10 - B.

For example, with 68 X 9, simply do 68 - 7 = 61, then append 10 - 8 = 2 to get 612.  
For 94 X 9, you merge 94 - 10 = 84 with 10 - 4 = 6 to obtain 846. 

***The underlying algebra is that for a given number 10A + B, with 0 < B < 9, we are computing 10[(10A + B) - (A + 1)] + (10 - B) = 90A + 9B = 9(10A + B)***

Consequently, this can be applied to larger numbers. For instance, to do 123 X 9, 123 - 13 = 110 is merged with 10 - 3 = 7 to get 1107.  

#### UPDATES!  

This method has been co-authored with Dr. Arthur Benjamin of Harvey Mudd College and submmitted to the Mathematics Association of America !
