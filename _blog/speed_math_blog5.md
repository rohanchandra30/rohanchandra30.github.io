Sometime during the winter of 2014, I realised I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. My grades were abysmal so there was no bright prospect there. I had no programming experience which immediately removed me from the eligibility criteria for 90% of the tech jobs in India. In India, an engineer has two career options to choose from - MBA or MS. At least, this is what we are brought up to believe.  
My grades and my lack of experience ruled out an MS. I set my sights on an eventual MBA degree but again, I needed work expperience for that
