Sometime during the winter of 2014, I realised I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. My grades were abysmal so there was no bright prospect there. I had no programming experience which immediately removed me from the eligibility criteria for 90% of the tech jobs in India. In India, an engineer has two career options to choose from - MBA or MS. At least, this is what we are brought up to believe.  

My grades and my lack of experience ruled out an MS. I set my sights on an eventual MBA degree but again, I needed work experience for that. I decided to enroll in the Berkeley Summer Session to take courses in economics and finance to see whether I would be happy in a business environment. I'm glad I did. Not only did I realise that my talents and skills lay in science and math, I gained a whole new perspective on how I viewed my life in the next 10 years, and it certainly wasn't MBA.  

I loved everything about the US. From the people to the weather, how things are run and managed. Its not just the cleanliness or the order of things. Its that if you want something or dream to do something, then you can do it relying only on your instincts and intellect. All you need is the drive, rest of the resources and opportunities are already present.  

College life in the US is much different from that in India. Students are allowed laptops and mobiles in the classroom, kids even bring in lunch and have their food during the lecture. There is much more emphasis given to assignments which can easily take a minimum of 10 hours to complete.

At Berkeley, classes start 10 minutes after the hour known as Berkeley time. It's a weird but effective system as students are hardwired to arrive at the hour and then proceed to take 10 minutes to settle down. I often went to the rec centre in the evenings where I played badminton and lifted weights.  

Dorm life was another new aspect for me. My roommate was a korean american and was a sophomore in the EECS program. The Berkeley EECS is one of the most coveted programs in the world and I felt priviliged to share a room with him. I spent most of my indoor time asking questions. My questions weren't centered on technical details, but more towards finding out how exactly  science and technology was taught. I discovered that engineering isnt at all like I had studied back in India. Here, the same concepts that had disillusioned me from studies in India were suddenly beginning to look interesting. I found Op-amps and rectifiers enjoyable to study and quickly got bored with ECON-135 and ECON-155. I started to sit in most of the math and engineering classes and realised that I had been approaching science all wrong. Here technology was treated differently. Emphasis was put on theory and practicals both.  

I made friends from all around the world. I particularly became good friends with a chinese-american who I spent most of my time with. We went to restaurants, nightclubs, movies, there is so much to do around Berkeley. I even celebrated my 21st birthday there !  

In my urban economics class, weekly debates were held on current socio-economics topics and my topic was on whether sports stadiums construction should be subsidized by the government or not. I led my team of 3 students and won the debate ! Below is a picture of the post victory dinner.

On my last day, I visited the Sather Tower in the middle of the campus. It's an iconic structure and the view from the top is great too. My dream is to pursue my graduate studies from UC Berkeley. The weird thing is that the desire to do so doesn't stem from the fact that it is one of the best places to pursue your education. Its that I had begun to fit there and feel like myself. I had begun to realise my identity and if I would ever want to realise my full potential, there is no better place than UC Berkeley.
