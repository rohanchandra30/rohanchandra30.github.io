description: I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/agrawala/">Dr. Ashok Agrawala</a> and <a href="http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~ppal/"> Dr. Piya Pal</a> in neural source localisation

After coming back from UC Berkeley in 2014 with my faith in science and technology restored, I wanted to go for experience more toward the computer science side. So I spent the summer of 2015 at the University of Maryland, College Park designing algorithms in MATLAB, working on the inverse problem of neural source localisation.  

The forward problem being- trying to determine the scalp potentials from a given current distribution, the inverse problem is just the opposite. I designed an algorithm that uses least squares estimation to figure out current distributions from estimated scalp potentials.
