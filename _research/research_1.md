description: I have been working with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=7pew59gAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Neeta Pandey</a> at DTU, one of India's best engineering institutes in the area of active building blocks in analog circuits.

I began by working with Dr. Neeta Pandey as her RA in her research group which focuses on designing active building blocks. My task was to extensively study Operational Transresistance Amplifiers (OTRA).  

Analog circuits I have modified and designed:

+ Notch Filters
+ All pass filter
+ Delay Equalisers
+ Digital to Analog converters

 I improve on the existing design by implementing the circuits with fewer active blocks which provided equi-capacitance capability. My design is able to provide gain-bandwidth independence, optimum slew rate and negligible parasitic effects while preserving basic op-amp functionality unlike previous designs.  

Early this year, I began independent research on higher order all-pass filters using OTRA’s. During simulations, I discovered that by tweaking the transfer function by using alternate component values, I could convert the all pass filter into a notch filter. I had created a totally new circuit which has now been **submitted to “Active and Passive Electronic Components”, Hindawi Publications**.  
Currently, as my final year thesis, I am implementing Digital-to-Analog/Analog-to-Digital (DAC/ADC) converters using OTRAs and I have already managed to create novel circuits for a weighted and an R-2R ladder configuration.
