At the end of the current semester, I would begin work as research assistant in Dr. Saket Anand's group at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi on autonomous robotics for 5-6 months. I will be using ROS to design computer vision algorithms based on geometric constraints imposed by the scene. Some broad spectrum topics that I would be working on are pedestrian detection, lane detection and road surface segmentation. At IIIT-Delhi, I will also be   enrolling in CSE 222: Algorithm Design and Analysis on a non-credit basis.
