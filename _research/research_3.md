description: I am scheduled to work with <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/">Dr. Saket Anand</a> in the field of autonomous robotics from december till june 2016.
---

At the end of the current semester, I would begin work as research assistant in Dr. Saket Anand's group at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi on autonomous robotics for 5-6 months. I will be using ROS to design computer vision algorithms based on geometric constraints imposed by the scene. Some broad spectrum topics that I would be working on are pedestrian detection, lane detection and road surface segmentation. At IIIT-Delhi starting from January, I will also be   auditing CSE 222: Algorithm Design and Analysis.

###***UPDATES***:

So I started off my first week by spending some time familiarizing myself with ROS and QT Creator. I am given 8 excersizes in opencv to  complete and my final assingment is to read in a live video feed and perform FAST feature and canny edge detection for each frame. When an object permeates the video feed, that particular frame is to be recorded.  

By working through these problem sets, I will gain an understanding of working in opencv. My next goal will be to interface opencv with ROS.
