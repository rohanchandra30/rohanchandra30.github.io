I am working as a research assistant in Dr. Saket Anand's group at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi on autonomous robotics for 5-6 months. We are one of the 13 teams cut down from 259 initially competing in the <a href="http://www.sparktherise.com/program-detail/driverless-car-challenge">"Spark For Rise"</a> driverless car challenge initiated by Mahindra. The objective of this competition is to revolutionise driving on the streets of India with the thinking that if autonomous cars can run on Indian roads, they can run on any road in the world.  

Our team is called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/swarathatiiitd">"Swarath"</a>. We are a mix of faculty and students from IIIT-Delhi, who together have expertise in vision, robotics, embedded systems, sensing, and communications. Our ultimate goal is to launch autonomous shuttles that provide anytime last mile connectivity in Indian cities.

###***UPDATES***:

#### First Week!  

So I started off my first week by spending some time familiarizing myself with ROS. ROS is Robot Operating System and is used to interface multiple nodes with each other. This is done by communicating asynchronously through topics or synchronously through services. A node is basically an executable that sends information via messages. One node publishes messages to a topic and another node subscribes to that message. This is how information is transmitted.  

For example, a light sensor can be interfaced as one node and motors can be interfaced as another node. Data can be streamed through the sensors, published to a topic and subscribed by the motors.
