I worked as a research assistant in Dr. Saket Anand's group at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi on autonomous robotics for 5-6 months. I worked on the driverless car project where I implemented a succesful lane detection algorithm that could detect even poorly painted lane markings.

I learned to work with 3D pointclouds and succesfully implemented a scan-matching ICP algorithm 

You can check out the Joystick controlled e-Rick and our lane detection algorithm below !

We are working on Way Point Navigation next and pretty soon, I'll be uploading a video of the e-Rick driving itself without the use of joystick!!

Obstacle Detection Added (at the end)
