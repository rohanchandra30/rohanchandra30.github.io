I am planning to start a blog for guidance for graduate school admissions along with a friend. I'm still waiting for my admits which should be sometime around February but I decided to start publishing some content right away.  

The 4 main things that PhD/MS admission committees look for is RELEVANT research experience, your undergrad courses and your grades in them, your letters of recommendation and your statement of purpose.

Chances= a% x (SOP) + b% x (LOR) + c% x (Research) + d% x (GPA) +­ (GRE)  

A few of the times, a couple of students come along who jump out of the page in one or two aspects. For example, they have a summer internship at Microsoft and if they did some good work, they get a recommendation letter from there too. Automatically in equation (1), the research and LOR term gets highlighted and it 'sticks' in the committee members heads. Basically thats what you have to go for. Do something or show something that sticks out and leaves an imprint on the committee so that they do not not reject you outright.  


You may have read on­line that universities WANT to get you and you need to just highlight your strong areas. That's wrong and pathetic advice, at least for the competitive programs. Programs like Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley will reject you outright unless you give them a compelling reason not to. It's harsh but true. Most usually only the top department rankers from the IIT's in India get selected for these programs. The compelling reason? Their rank and university. Basically if you don't grab THESE students, who the hell else WILL you pick? So the real advice is­ don't just highlight your strong areas, highlight those areas which the univs would care about. No one cares about your 5 years of guitar lessons(that's something that should go in the extra curricular section of your resume, nowhere else), show them your aptitude in research.  

One more thing in general that the committee looks for is how well prepared you are in your field. In your descriptions of your past research and courses, profs will read between the lines and focus, not only on what you did (that they will just glean from a one to two line description of the project) but on what results you derived from the project. They want to see whether you grasped the big picture of what you were doing. The way you write about your research will demonstrate your in depth knowledge of the project. A 3 year stint in a communications lab where your main job description was that of a technician, repairing wires and maintaining the equipment will not fetch you any points as compared to a summer internship program where you followed a carefully structured regimen where your knowledge base increased each week and you were able to derive meaningful results which helped you improve your understanding of the subject. You see my point?  

The main takeaway from this post is that you need to make good use of your time. Make sure you are working towards developing something and learning at each moment of your life. It all comes down to this- They want to know if you are intelligent and capable to carry out their grad programs. Show them what you've got to offer. Introspect. Learn yourself and your strong points. And at the end, you should be able to say - "Hey look. I'm right here. This is all of me. Make your decision fast and let me know when I can start !"
