I am planning to start a blog for guidance for graduate school admissions along with a friend. I'm still waiting for my admits which should be sometime around February but I decided to start publishing some content right away.  

The 4 main things that PhD/MS admission committees look for is RELEVANT research experience, your undergrad courses and your grades in them, your letters of recommendation and your statement of purpose.

Chances= a% x (SOP) + b% x (LOR) + c% x (Research) + d% x (GPA) +­ (GRE)  

A few of the times, a couple of students come along who jump out of the page in one or two aspects. For example, they have a summer internship at Microsoft and if they did some good work, they get a recommendation letter from there too. Automatically in equation (1), the research and LOR term gets highlighted and it 'sticks' in the committee members heads. Basically thats what you have to go for. Do something or show something that sticks out and leaves an imprint on the committee so that they do not not reject you outright.  


You may have read on­line that universities WANT to get you and you need to just highlight your strong areas. That's wrong and pathetic advice, at least for the competitive programs. Programs like Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley will reject you outright unless you give them a compelling reason not to. It's harsh but true. Most usually only the top department rankers from the IIT's in India get selected for these programs. The compelling reason? Their rank and university. Basically if you don't grab THESE students, who the hell else WILL you pick? So the real advice is­ don't just highlight your strong areas, highlight those areas which the univs would care about. No one cares about your 5 years of guitar lessons(that's something that should go in the extra curricular section of your resume, nowhere else), show them your aptitude in research.
