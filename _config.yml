aboutme: "Welcome to my website. My name is Rohan Chandra.I am a senior at Delhi Technological University, New Delhi. My hobbies are playing chess and mathemagics. The latter is a just a fancy term for vedic math or speed math. My favorite game is the one where you take apart the number from the number plate of the car in front of you and multiply it in your head. My record is 13 cars in 56 seconds. So the take away is you probably shouldn't get into a car with me. Thanks for visiting my site." #\SARTHAK
