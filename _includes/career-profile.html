<p align="justify">I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://amrl.cs.utexas.edu/">AMRL</a> hosted by Joydeep Biswas. I defended my PhD in April 2022 at the University of Maryland where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha">Dr. Dinesh Manocha</a> in autonomous driving. I completed my Masters in CS from UMD in 2018 under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/">Dr. Tom Goldstein</a> and bachelors in ECE from DTU, India in 2016.
