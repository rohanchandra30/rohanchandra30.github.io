    <p>I am a first year PhD student working with Dr. Dinesh Manocha. In my free time, I answer questions on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Rohan-Chandra-9" target="_new"> on Quora.</a> about education, academia, and graduate school admissions. </br></br>
<!--Here is my <a href="/attachments/research_statement.pdf" target="_new">research statement.</a> Here is my one page <a href="/attachments/Cover_Letter.pdf" target="_new">cover letter</a> on how I differ from other candidates.--> 

In addition to being a doctoral student, I also have extensive experience teaching maths to people of all ages, and all abilities. Here are my most recent TA evaluations for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/comments.png" target="_blank">Fall 2017</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ta.png" target="_blank"> Spring 2018.</a> </br></br>

Outside of academia, I am addicted to all elements of the following set: <i>{maths, chess, the dragonball franchise, fitness, coffee, writing, reading}.</i> Conversing with me is easy if the topic of conversation belongs to this set. If not, then good luck getting me to talk.
