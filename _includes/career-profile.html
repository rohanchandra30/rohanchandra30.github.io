    <p>I am a second year Masters student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My academic advisor is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" target="_new">Tom Goldstein</a>. I am broadly interested in solving non-convex optimization problems. Currently, I'm trying to solve low rank matrix estimation in the natural parameter space without lifting to higher dimenions.</br>

    Previously, I worked on Phase Retrieval. Over the past few months, we created Phasepack, a MATLAB based library to solve phase retrieval using classical and contemporary routines.</a></p></br>
