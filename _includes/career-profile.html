    <p align="justify">I am a third year PhD student at the University of Maryland working with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha">Dr. Dinesh Manocha</a>. My research lies in the intersection of traffic psychology, mathematics, and machine learning with applications in autonomous driving. Previously, I completed my MS from UMD in 2018 under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/">Dr. Tom Goldstein</a>, and bachelors in ECE from DTU, India in 2016 with supervision from Dr. Neeta Pandey.</p>

    <!--I also answer questions on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Rohan-Chandra-9" target="_new"> on Quora.</a></br></br>-->

<!--Here is my <a href="/attachments/research_statement.pdf" target="_new">research statement.</a> Here is my one page <a href="/attachments/Cover_Letter.pdf" target="_new">cover letter</a> on how I differ from other candidates.--> 

<p align="justify"> In addition to being a doctoral student and a top writer on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Rohan-Chandra-9" target="_new"> on Quora</a>, I also have extensive experience teaching maths to people of different ages. Here are my most recent TA evaluations for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/comments.png" target="_blank">Fall 2017</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ta.png" target="_blank"> Spring 2018.</a></p> </br></br>

<!--Outside of academia, I am addicted to all elements of the following set: <i>{mental maths, chess, the dragonball franchise, fitness, coffee}.</i> Conversing with me is easy if the topic of conversation belongs to this set. If not, then good luck getting me to talk.-->
