    <p>I am a second year Masters student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am currently interested in NP-Hard Optimization problems. Specifically, I am interested in convex relaxtions and non-convex approaches to combinatorial optimizations. I was previously involved in sparse signal recovery (commonly known as compressed sensing).</br>
