<hr>

<ol>

<li><b>Multi-agent Planning and Navigation</b></li> I am broadly interested in making robots navigate safely, efficiently, and with social compliance, in challenging environments that include humans. My specific research interests within this domain span decentralized planning under private incentives, physics-informed planning, planning-constrained perception. 


<li><b>Autonomous Driving</b></li> I am also interested in continuing to extend autonomous driving to denser, heterogeneous, and more unstructured traffic environments such as that in India.
