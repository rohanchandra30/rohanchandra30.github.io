<p align="justify">I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Maryland working with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha">Dr. Dinesh Manocha</a> in the field of autonomous driving. My dissertation lays out a blueprint for an entirely new autonomous driving stack from the ground up for dense, heterogeneous, and unstructured surroundings. This includes developing new algorithms and systems to perceive, predict, and plan among human drivers in traffic typical of developing nations.
<br><br>
I completed my Masters in CS from UMD in 2018 under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/">Dr. Tom Goldstein</a>, and bachelors in ECE from DTU, India in 2016.

<!--<p align="justify"> In addition to being a doctoral student and a top writer on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Rohan-Chandra-9" target="_new"> on Quora</a>, I also have extensive experience teaching maths to people of different ages.
