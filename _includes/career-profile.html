    <p>I am a CS PhD student at the University of Maryland working with Dr. Dinesh Manocha.</p>

    <!--I also answer questions on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Rohan-Chandra-9" target="_new"> on Quora.</a></br></br>-->

<!--Here is my <a href="/attachments/research_statement.pdf" target="_new">research statement.</a> Here is my one page <a href="/attachments/Cover_Letter.pdf" target="_new">cover letter</a> on how I differ from other candidates.--> 

In addition to being a doctoral student and a top writer on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Rohan-Chandra-9" target="_new"> on Quora</a>, I also have extensive experience teaching maths to people of all ages, and all abilities. Here are my most recent TA evaluations for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/comments.png" target="_blank">Fall 2017</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ta.png" target="_blank"> Spring 2018.</a> </br></br>

Outside of academia, I am addicted to all elements of the following set: <i>{mental maths, chess, the dragonball franchise, fitness, coffee}.</i> Conversing with me is easy if the topic of conversation belongs to this set. If not, then good luck getting me to talk.



   </p><b>NEW!</b>&nbsp I'll be starting the PhD in Computer Science program at UMD next Fall! <br>
       <b>NEW!</b>&nbsp Webpage for my new research on tracking coming soon. Under construction <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/trackingWebpage.html" target="new"> here. </a>
