<li><b>How can autonomous agents navigate like humans?</b></li> Humans move in a decentralized manner avoiding collisions relying only on local information gleaned from their environment. State-of-the-art robot navigation can avoid collisions fairly well. Humans, however, don't <i>just</i> do collision avoidance. We also navigate dense, constrained, and unstructured environments efficiently without getting stuck. This is where autonomous agents fail. How can autonomous agents safely and efficiently reach their goals in dense and constrained environments?


<li><b>What are some of the behavioral characteristics that autonomous agents should imbibe?</b></li> Humans take calculated risks all the time to maximize efficiency. You see it when people speed up to overtake slow-moving agents in traffic and crowds. Or when multiple cars arrive at a 4-way intersection: to avoid a stand-off, one driver must either take the initiative and go first, or proactively propose a solution by waving other drivers through the intersection. Can autonomous agents understand and emulate proactive behavior?


<li><b>What is the role of perception in achieving human-like autonomy in challenging environments?</b></li> Back home in India, I used to drive my grandfather's car, that didn't have working wipers, amidst heavy rain all the time. Do autonomous agents really need perfect perception? Given a navigation specification, how much perception quality can agents afford to sacrifice?
