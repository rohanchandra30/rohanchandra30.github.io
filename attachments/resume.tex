\textbf{Developed Phasepack: }Phase Retrieval is an example of a non-convex quadratic program with
quadratic constraints. In the real-valued case, it is a combinatorial problem which is known to be NP-hard. Despite
this observation, recent years have seen the development of new algorithms that solve phase retrieval problems ef-
fectively. Unfortunately, because of the lack of publicly available real-world data, the lack of a common software
interface for different algorithms, and a knowledge gap between practitioners and theoreticians, only little work has
been devoted to compare and evaluate newer phase retrieval methods. So we created Phasepack, comprehensive library that compiles all the algorithms within a uniform interface.

\SubBulletItem
\textbf{Low Rank Matrix Recovery: }Another example of intractability associated with non-convexity is low rank matrix recovery with quadratic measurement constraints where a solution is
obtained by lifting the problem to a higher parameter space. To elaborate, lifting expresses a system of quadratic
measurements as a system of linear equations whose solution is a matrix that obeys a rank constraint. However,
working with matrices instead of vectors in higher dimensions generally means incurring large storage costs. As
part of my MS thesis I am trying to solve the problem of low rank matrix recovery from quadratic measurement
constraints without lifting i.e. in the natural parameter space. We observed that that Phasemax (Goldstein and Studor, 2016) solves phase retrieval by recovering solutions in the same space as the input without lifting to higher
dimensions. Consequently it is a better alternative to current lifting solutions for solving SDPâ€™s. Initial sketches of
my proof look promising and I am currently in the process of formalizing this.
